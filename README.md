# The Argument for Physical Sciences in Computer Science
Throughout my brief undergraduate career, I’ve heard numerous classmates who wanted to go into software engineering complain about the higher-level math and physics courses we were required to take. 

They would often say that they were going to graduate and never touch subjects such as related rates, differentials, or proofs by induction. But is this really true?

High-level math concepts find numerous practical applications in computer science, enriching various areas of study and industry applications. Linear algebra, for instance, serves as the backbone for many algorithms in machine learning and computer graphics. Techniques like matrix multiplication are fundamental in neural network training, where they enable efficient computation of transformations between layers of neurons. Calculus plays a vital role in optimization algorithms, aiding in the fine-tuning of models by minimizing or maximizing objective functions. 

The purpose of this course is to teach the math-skeptical programmer the importance of advanced mathematical concepts in programming. We’ll be examining the applications of linear algebra and calculus in machine learning, using Matlab programs to visualize as we go. By the end of this course, the student should have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

-[] Python fundamentals
-[] Supervised vs. Unsupervised learning
-[] Regularization
-[] Optimization 
-[] Linear Programming

A grasp on how to use the following technologies and frameworks:

-[] Tensorflow
-[] MATLAB
-[] SciPy
-[] PuLP

As well as this repertoire of ML projects in their portfolio:

-[] 3d matrix calculator with Python and MATLAB
-[] Linear Regression Modeler with Python and MATLAB
-[] Delivery Route Optimization Web App
-[] Optimal Return Stock Portfolio Management Tool
